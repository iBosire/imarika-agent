Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Prepare the land until it is fine tilth by using either hoes, bullock or tractor.
Plough the selected site.
Harrow to a fine tilth the ploughed land.
Plough the field 3 times; 2 of these ploughings should be done within an interval of 8-10 days in between during the nursery preparation.
After ploughing the field, make it level using a wooden leveler.
","Excess water on the other hand can result in soil waterlogging.  
Finger millet cannot tolerate water logging.  Prepare furrows and ridges for irrigation purpose, it serves dual purpose of irrigation and drainage.
Excess water can also lead to soil erosion and compromise soil fertility and suitability for finger millet.
Use cut-off and create water-ways to drain excess water runoff this will eliminate waterlogging and therefore ensure sustainable crop yields.","
 Prepare the land well in advance of planting.
 This involves removing weeds, rocks, and other debris that can interfere
 with planting and growth. 
Till the soil to a depth of about 6-8 inches to allow for good water penetration.
"
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"Use appropriate fertilizer.
Apply 50 kg of NPK fertilizer per acre. 3-5 tons per acre of farmyard can also be applied.
Apply farmyard manure and mix with soil before sowing.
Top dress with 50kg of CAN per acre.
Apply fertilizers on the basis of soil test results. In the absence of a soil test apply diammonium phosphate at 100 kg/ha as a basal dose before sowing and 100 kg urea/ha as top-dressing 21 days after sowing.
",,"
Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. In dry conditions,
 use fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus, as these promote 
good root growth and early crop development.
"
Planting ,Sowing,"Temperature range 
The temperatures should be 10 – 30 o C.

Rainfall
The rainfall should be 250– 1000 mm 

The seed should be clean and dressed with fungicide
Organic fertilizer is to be applied one month before planting
Apply lime one month before planting.
Plant in rows 30cm between rows and 10-15 cm between plants.
Plant by drilling.
Sowing is usually done by broadcasting or planting seeds in furrows.
The seedbed should be thoroughly prepared to a fine tilth because the seeds are very tiny.
Finger millet should be planted as early as possible in the season on the onset of rains. The earlier it is sown the higher the yields.
The crop can be planted as a pure stand or intercropped with other crops like maize, beans, and cowpeas, among others.
Germination occurs within a week after sowing.","They can tolerate temperatures as low as 100 c, however, very cold temperature hampers growth",Apply supplemental irrigation after sowing if the soil is not moist enough; irrigate again if leaves wilt at any stage of crop growth and to ensure enough moisture in soil at flowering.
Harvest,Harvesting ,"Finger millet matures from 3-5 months depending on the variety.
Physiological maturity is when a pinch of grain does not crush into milky substance when rubbed between thumb and fore-finger.
Finger Millet can easily shatter if harvesting is delayed after physiological maturity.
This can lead to up to 15 % losses depending on variety
Birds can also cause significant losses.
Keenly monitor grains on head for physiological maturity
Harvest by cutting off the heads using a billhook knife or any appropriate tool","Delay harvesting until the weather improves to l prevent damage to
the crop and ensure that the grain is of good quality.
Use appropriate harvesting equipment such as  sickle to harvest the
 crop is better than using a combine harvester that may cause damage to the crop.
Dry the crop to prevent mold and other fungal diseases.
","Harvest the crop as soon as the heads turn brown and the grains
 are fully mature. 
Delayed harvesting can lead to grain losses due to shattering.
"
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Reduce spillage, contamination, germination, spoilage and pests through use of grain dryer if available, sun drying on a clean surface like a cement slab or canvas spread and turn frequently; drying for 4 – 5 days.
For Loss Management at Threshing use of a thresher if available but can also winnow by pounding on clean surface like canvas. Avoid pounding on hard surfaces to avoid grain breakage; avoid pounding on bare ground to avoid grit recover all grain.
For Loss Management at transportation use right packaging and handling to minimize losses; maintain hygiene in carriages; air-tight, cool, and dry carriers.
For Loss Management in Storage use traditional well ventilated and kept granaries; tightly closed containers kept  in cool, dark and dry rooms; Hermetic storage bags/silos (PICS, AgroZ, ZeroFly, Elites, Metal Silos or Plastic Silos).
Control insect pests like larger and lesser grain borers.  They may not bore into the small finger millet grain but they destroy storage bags, nimble on the grain pericarp, and deposit their waste on the grain, hence compromising quality and quantity.
Finger millet grain can stay unspoilt for up to 20 years."," Dry the grains in the sun for a few days to bring down the moisture 
content to around 12-14%.
 Store the dried grains in clean and dry containers to prevent infestation by pests and rodents.
","
Store the grain in a clean, dry, and well-ventilated area to prevent spoilage.
 Use appropriate storage containers, such as metal or plastic
 bins, to protect the grain from pests and moisture.
