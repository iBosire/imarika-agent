Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Prepare land during the dry season to kill perennial weeds


Plough deep enough using hand hoe, ox-plough or tractor for root expansion. 
Harrowing may be necessary to ensure an appropriate tilth. In dry environment, 
Prepare ridges 30-45 cm high, 60 cm wide, and spaced 1.0 m apart 
manually, by oxen, or a tractor ridge along the contours 
Ridges  minimize runoff and reduces soil erosion
If preparing mounds/heaps space 60-100 cm wide and 30- 60 cm high, prepare manually using a hoe or jembe.
","Start by preparing the land. If the soil is too wet,
 it may need to be drained or dried out before planting.
","Prepare land during the dry season to kill perennial weeds.
Use sunken beds for moisture retention.
Till the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches to loosen the soil and 
improve drainage. 
"
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"Apply well-rotten farmyard/poultry manure at the rate of one
 debe and 25-50 g of NPK(17:17:17) per m2 
based on the analyzed and tested soil.
"," Apply a balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10 at planting time. 
Then apply additional fertilizer after the vines have started to spread, 
and again just before the vines start to run.
"," It's important to maintain soil fertility by adding nutrients. 
Use a balanced fertilizer that includes nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium. You may also consider adding micronutrients, such as iron, 
manganese, and zinc, which are essential for plant growth.
"
Planting ,Sowing,"Plant early at appropriate spacing and where intercropping is
 done with maize, then spacing for maize is adjusted to accommodate the sweet potato
Plant vines at an angle of 45 degrees, 30 cm apart, 
with vine ends (bases) towards the centre of the ridge, ⅔ covered with soil, leaving ⅓ above the soil. 
Where ridges are wider than 1.0 m, double rows at 30 cm apart can be planted on ridge.
 It can also be grown on terraces
Plant 3-4 vines of 20-30 cm length on each mound equidistantly in a triangular pattern
Plant on ridges or mounds/heaps, as relay in cereals 
or as a monocrop in the second season at onset of rains which also acts as a cover crop to reduce soil erosion. 
Both ridges and mounds should give a plant population of 13,500 plants per acre. 
","Consider planting sweet potatoes in raised beds to improve drainage. 
This will help prevent water from accumulating around the roots, which can lead to rotting.
Avoid planting sweet potatoes in the midst of heavy rains or immediately after. 
Wait until the soil has had a chance to dry out a bit before planting.
","Plant your sweet potato slips when there is still some moisture in the soil. 
Avoid planting during periods of prolonged drought or 
when the soil is extremely dry. Planting in the early morning or
 late afternoon when the temperatures 
"
Harvest,Harvesting ,"Cut off the vines 10-14 days prior to harvesting
The vines should be reserved for future planting
Harvest carefully not to damage remaining roots
Sweet potato will produce 35 – 95 bags per acre and 13,500 vines/acre
Harvested vines should be stored under shade
Tie vines in bundles of 50 or 100 pieces. 
Label package to show variety, contact of the vine multiplier and date of harvest. 
The vines are put in gunny bags 1000 vines each and should be aerated most of the time.
Transport planting materials immediately after harvesting, possibly in the evening or at night.
Untie and empty the bags to avoid accumulation of heat in the bags which can damage the vines.
","Harvest sweet potatoes when the leaves begin to yellow and wither. 
Allow the sweet potatoes to cure for a week or two in a warm,
 dry place before storing.

","Harvest the sweet potatoes when they are mature, 
but avoid harvesting during extremely dry periods. 
The sweet potatoes will be more challenging to dig up, 
and they may be more prone to damage.
"
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Keep harvested roots protected from direct sunshine to avoid shrinkage and shrivelling, 
Wash, sort, and grade the harvested roots, depending on the intended use
Washing is to remove soil from the roots without bruising the skin
Sorting is done to remove rotten, damaged, malformed and weevil infested roots, and debris
Grading is done to sorted roots to have uniform produce, based on size, shape, 
colour, weight, maturity, market demand
","Store sweet potatoes in a cool, dark, and dry place. 
Sweet potatoes can be stored for several months if stored properly.
","After harvesting, cure the sweet potatoes for a week 
in a warm, humid location. Then store them in a cool, 
dark place to help extend their shelf life.
