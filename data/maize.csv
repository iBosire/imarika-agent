Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Add manure and fertilizer with recommendations from soil testing and analysis
Consider minimum tillage to reduce cost and to conserve soil, water and nutrients and to reduce workload
Slash and plant using appropriate tools e.g. rippers, jab planters, dibbler, oxen drawn equipment e.g. the ripper, tractor drawn no till planter
Ploughing of the soil should be done using chisel ploughs to avoid fine tilths. Hoes and oxen drawn implements can also be used
Contour farming technique recommended
Add manure and fertilizers to the soil in the right amounts to provide the required plant nutrients for vigorous crop growth","
Proper land preparation is essential for planting maize in wet conditions.
 Start by clearing the land and removing any debris that may impede plant growth.
 If the soil is compacted, consider using a deep tillage implement or a subsoiler to loosen the soil. 
Ensure that the field is well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to crop failure.
","Ensure that the soil is well-prepared by tilling the land to a
depth of 15-20 cm to improve soil aeration and drainage. 
Add organic matter to the soil, such as compost or manure,
 to improve the soil's water-holding capacity.
","Prepare your Maize land for planting early (before the rains start). 
 This helps to kill weeds & insects that hide in the soil.
 Do a soil test to check on nutrition.",
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"Maize requires three primary nutrients – nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K).
Potash (K) is the nutrient required in the greatest amount by maize,
Maize is not very sensitive to trace element deficiencies, but boron, copper, zinc, manganese and iron may occasionally be deficient on soils where manure is not applied regularly.
","Apply fertilizer at the recommended rate to ensure optimal crop growth.
Nitrogen is particularly important for maize growth, and 
additional applications may be necessary during the growing season.
","The deleterious effects of drought can be mediated by application of nutrients which may enhance tolerance to drought stress.
Among the nutrients potassium can enhance the tolerance in maize plant for drought stress. Similarly, potassium increased leaf water potential, osmotic potential and turgor potential under drought stress.","Before planting your Maize, mix a handful of manure with the soil per hole, 
 add 1 teaspoon DAP or NPK eg 20:20:20 in acidic soils & mix well.",
Planting ,Sowing,"Temperature range 
The temperatures should be  25 – 30 o C.

Rainfall
The rainfall should be 400 – 1200 mm 

Select seed grains situated at the middle of the cob and discard grains at the base and the tip of the cob
Seeds should be obtained from reliable sources
Farmer saved seeds are alternatives where certified seeds aren’t available or the seed can be bought from the market
Plant at the onset of rains at a spacing of 75cm x 25 or 30cm, 1 seed per hole 5 cm deep
Plant at the onset of rains e.g. 4 continuous days of sufficient rain – to take advantage of nitrogen flush
Plant along the contours or across the slope
Conduct germination test before planting
Plant when the soil is moist and plant certified maize varieties tolerant to striga weed IR- Coated Maize Varieties e.g. Ua Kayongo
Maize pure stand: 75cm x 25 or 30cm, 1 seed per hole, 5 cm deep and 2.5-5 cm for moist planting
Fill gaps one to two weeks after planting when plants have emerged
","Plant maize seeds at the recommended depth, typically between 
1-2 inches deep, and 8-12 inches apart. Plant in rows to facilitate weed
control and improve water infiltration. 
Planting should be done when the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
"," Planting should be done at the beginning of the rainy season or 
after the first rains. 
This will help ensure that the seedlings have sufficient moisture 
to establish and grow. 
Plant seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm and a spacing of 60-75 cm 
between rows and 20-30 cm between plants.
","Plant your maize seeds at the onset of rains with a spacing of 75cm x 30cm. 
 Plant 1 seed per hole which should be 5cm deep.",
Harvest,Harvesting ,"Harvesting by cutting and stalking to enhance drying and prevent pathogen infestation
Harvesting is done when the crop reaches harvest maturity 10 to 15 days after physiological maturity
Harvesting is done by cutting and stalking to enhance drying, make it easy to harvest and to prevent pathogen infestation
Harvest by de-husking."," Harvest maize when the kernels are fully mature and dry. 
Avoid harvesting when the plants are wet, as this can lead 
to mold growth and spoilage.
","
Maize is usually ready for harvest 3-4 months after planting. 
Harvesting should be done when the kernels are fully mature and dry.
 Cut the stalks at ground level and remove the ears for drying.
","Maize matures 4 to 9 months after planting depending on the
  variety and altitude.Harvesting maize is done by cutting and stalking to dry.",
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Transport maize from the field to the place of shelling using clean transport equipment dry before shelling winnow to remove dust
Accessible methods of determining or estimating moisture content can be used
If insecticides are used to preserve maize, store it in sisal or jute bags on raised pallets to protect from rodents and chaff
Store in airtight bags or metallic silos and minimize use of pesticides
Transport maize from the field to the place of shelling using clean transport equipment
Dry before shelling and winnow to remove dust and chaff
Control weevils and grain borers by drying the maize to 13-14% moisture content to avoid grain attack by fungal infections such as aflatoxin","Proper post-harvest handling is critical to preserve the quality of the maize crop. 
Store maize in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area to
prevent mold growth and insect infestation. 
Consider using airtight containers or bags to prevent moisture from
entering the storage area
","Proper storage is important to prevent spoilage and maintain grain quality. 
Store maize in a cool, dry place with good ventilation to 
prevent moisture buildup. 
Check the grain regularly for signs of insect damage or mold.
","Dry the maize before shelling. Winnow to remove dust and chaff.
  Control weevils, grain borers & aflatoxin by drying the maize to 13-14% moisture",
