Groth Stages,Farming Activities,Normal Conditions (ideal condition),Wetter than Normal (Higher than ideal),Drier than Normal (Lower than Ideal)
Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Plough a fallow land, if planted as second season crop one plough is sufficient.Practice contour farming technique
Add manure and fertilizers to the soil in the right amounts to provide the required plant nutrients for vigorous crop growth
Maintain adequate soil health, soil nutrients, soil depth and moisture holding capacity
Soil testing and analysis is necessary for tailored soil amendments and nutrient replenishment
","The soil should be well-drained to prevent waterlogging, 
which can damage the roots of the sorghum plant. 
To improve soil drainage, you can add organic matter such as compost or manure.
","Start by preparing the land thoroughly before planting. 
This involves clearing the land of weeds and debris, and breaking 
up the soil to allow for proper water penetration. 
Till the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches to allow for better water retention.
"
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"nutrient requirements include: N, P, K, Zn, S, Cl, Mg,
 Ca, Fe, B, Cu, Mn
","
 Apply the recommended fertilizer according to the soil test results, 
taking into account the wet conditions. 
Excess water can lead to the leaching of nutrients, so you may need to
 apply more fertilizer than usual.
","Apply fertilizer to the soil before planting to help the sorghum 
plants establish a strong root system. 
Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorus, as this nutrient promotes root growth.
"
Planting ,Sowing,"Plant at the onset of rain and intercropping should be 
done with an appropriate cover crop
Direct planting of seeds is done by sowing directly into furrows 
drill at a spacing of 45 x 60  75cm x 20cm for mono-crop 
90 cm x 30 cm for inter-crop with legume or maize
Drill then thin to 12-20 cm between plants in furrows, 3-4 weeks after emergence
Seed rate; 7-12 Kg per Ha 
Traditional planting broadcasting can also be applied
","Plant the seeds in moist soil at a depth of 2-3 cm, 
and at a distance of 30-40 cm apart in rows that are 75-90 cm apart. 
Ensure that the seedbed is level and firm to prevent seedlings from being washed away by heavy rainfall.
","Very low seed rate is applicable in very dry conditions
In dry condition seeds should be placed at 5 cm depth 
and 2.5-4.0 cm in moist soil
"
Harvest,Harvesting,"Sorghum is harvested after 3 to 4 months after planting when weather is dry
Check the moisture content of the dry grain using a moisture meter or salt method. 
Salt will stick on grain which is not adequately dried when the grain is put
 in a container of salt and shaken
Store the dry grain in airtight bags or metallic silos
","
Harvest sorghum when the seed heads are fully mature, 
and the moisture content of the grains is between 12-14%.
Cut the sorghum heads off at the base of the stalks and allow them to dry before threshing.
","Harvest the sorghum when the seeds are fully mature and have turned brown. 
Cut the heads from the plants and allow them to dry in a warm,
dry place for several days. 
Once the seeds are fully dry, thresh them to separate them from the chaff.
"
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Dry the harvested sorghum panicles on mats air tarpaulins
Drying prevents contamination of the grain with mycotoxins
Thresh the dry sorghum panicles
Dry the threshed grain to a moisture content of 13% or less
Winnow to remove chuff","Store the sorghum grains in a dry, cool and well-ventilated 
place to avoid moisture build-up and pest infestations. 
Use appropriate storage containers such as airtight bags or
bins to prevent moisture and insect damage.
","Store the sorghum seeds in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture 
from accumulating and spoiling the crop.
Proper storage will ensure that the sorghum remains fresh 
and nutritious for longer.
