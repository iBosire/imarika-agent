Planting ,Land Preparation ,"Cassava should be grown away from trees to avoid shading Ensure deep and light soil to allow root development
Cassava mostly utilizes nitrogen fixed by leguminous plants
Prepare land early, especially during the dry season, preferably 2 months before planting.
Harrow to a medium tilth.
Analyse the soil and cassava nutrient requirement for various soil types. 
Add manure and fertilizers to the soil in the right amounts to provide the required plant.","Avoid planting cassava in low-lying areas or areas that are prone to flooding.
Improve drainage by digging drainage channels or creating raised beds.
Ensure that the soil is well-drained and not waterlogged before planting.
","Prepare the land by clearing it of weeds, rocks, and debris. 
Tilling the soil to loosen it will make it easier for cassava roots to penetrate the soil. It is also important to ensure that the soil is properly fertilized with the right nutrients to encourage growth.
"
Planting ,Nutrient Management ,"To obtain high cassava yields it is recommended to apply most of the crop’s nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements in the form of chemical fertilizers while also applying relatively small amounts (5 t/ha) of animal manures in order to supply also the essential secondary and micronutrients as well as organic matter, which will improve soil structure, water holding capacity and aggregate stability. 
Farmers need to maintain and improve soil quality and health using a number of other “Save and Grow” measures, such as conservation tillage, intercropping, green manuring, mulching crop residues and cover crops, alley cropping, and applying animal manure or compost.
Intercropping with grain legumes, which fix atmospheric nitrogen, make some N available to the cassava crop.
","Apply fertilizer at the right time and rate. 
Over-fertilizing can lead to waterlogging and nutrient runoff,
 while under-fertilizing can reduce yields. 
Apply fertilizer at the right time and rate based on soil test results to ensure optimal plant growth.
","Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as NPK 15:15:15,
at the time of planting and again after about 6-8 weeks. 
This will provide the necessary nutrients for growth and help the cassava cope 
with the stress of drier conditions.
"
Planting ,Sowing,"Temperature range 
The temperatures should be  25 – 29 o C.

Rainfall
The rainfall should be 1000 – 1500 mm 

Pre-planting
Plant cuttings in a well-prepared field at a spacing of either 100 cm x 50 cm or 50 cm x 50 cm.
Use mini-stem cuttings of 2-4 nodes in rapid seed multiplication technique.
Select a well-drained, flat site for the nursery bed, near a source of water. 
Choose a nursery bed of 1.0 – 1.2 m width, at least 30 cm high, and convenient length. 
Plant hardwood mini cuttings horizontally, at a spacing of 10 cm x 10 cm, and a depth of 4 cm to 5 cm. Place cuttings so that two adjacent nodes are on the right and left sides.
Plant semi-mature cuttings vertically at a spacing of 10 cm x 10 cm with two-thirds of the cuttings and the old ends buried.
Plant tip-shoot cuttings in the same manner as semi-mature cuttings, at a spacing of 10 cm x 10 cm. Bury two-thirds of the cuttings in the soil.
Alternatively, for rapid seed multiplication method, Plant mini-stem cuttings in strong, black, disposable bags / containers.
Perforate the bags at the sides and bottom to allow drainage, and fill with good quality garden soil; or soil-less media, following the same planting procedure as for nursery beds.

Planting
Planting materials should be obtained from accredited nurseries/institutions like JKUAT, KALRO and Private certified companies 
Tie the harvested stems together in bundles of 50 or 100, and package for sale in bags (1,000 cuttings/bag)
Apply rapid seed multiplication method to overcome the problem of low multiplication ratio (a ratio of 1:10) in cassava planting material development.
There are three different orientations in which cassava is planted:
Vertical position, at an angle (450-600). Vertical or angled (slanting) orientation, make sure the buds are facing upwards. Plant the stakes at an angle of 45o–60o during rainy season. Place ⅔ of the stake buried in the soil
For horizontal planting (flat), burry the cutting 5 to 10cm horizontally so that the entire cutting lies beneath the soil. Flat position is done during dry season
Cuttings planted vertically at an angle sprout within 7-10 days while cuttings planted horizontally sprout within 14-21 days","
Plant cassava stem cuttings at a depth of 5-10 cm in well-drained soil.
Space the cuttings at a distance of 1 meter apart in rows that are 1.5 meters apart.
Ensure that the stem cuttings are planted in a vertical position with the buds facing up.
","

Plant cassava at the onset of the rainy season to give the crop enough time to 
establish before the dry spell sets in. 
Plant cassava in rows spaced about 1.5m apart and 1m between plants.
This spacing allows the cassava plant to develop a strong root system that can penetrate deeper into the soil in search of water.
Plant cassava cuttings at a 45-degree angle, burying 2/3 of the stem.
"
Harvest,Harvesting ,"Harvesting of root tubers for piece meal or selling is done at 9-12 months after planting, depending on variety.
Harvesting is commonly done manually by uprooting the whole plant or piece-meal harvesting using a fork jembe / hoe
Cassava can also be harvested mechanically, and the roots picked by hand. Harvesting is easier when cassava is planted on ridges and in loose or sandy soils; and during the wet season. 
Too early harvesting results in lower root yield and starch content while delayed harvesting leads to development of woody, fibrous roots and reduction in starch content
Use a sharp knife to separate roots from the stem to minimize damage. Cut each as close to the stem as possible, leaving a short section of the stem attached, may help to prevent spread of decay","Harvest cassava when it is fully mature and the leaves have started to yellow. 
Use appropriate harvesting tools such as machetes or digging forks to
minimize damage to the roots. 
Avoid harvesting during periods of heavy rain, as this can lead to soil erosion and damage 
crop.
","Harvest the cassava roots when they are mature, usually between 8-12 months 
after planting. The roots can be left in the ground for up to 18 months, 
but it is best to harvest them before the dry season intensifies."
Harvest,Post Harvest Handling ,"Curing improves the potential market life by reducing water loss and lowering the incidence of decay during storage
Tubers intended for storage should be properly cured after harvest: Curing is a process where cassava tubers are exposed to conditions that will toughen the skin to protect them from damage and heal any existing wounds to reduce chances of perishability (browning of the flesh and softening of the roots)
Optimal conditions for curing are 26-30oC and 90-95% relative humidity for 4 days
Pile cassava partially shaded area outdoors: Cut grasses or straw can be used as insulating material and the pile should be covered with canvas, burlap or woven grass mats
May also use a protected structure at ambient temperatures, provided the relative humidity is high.
rade the harvested cassava in the field and discard damaged or infected roots Remove loose soil from the root surface
Put the harvested roots under shade for sorting and grading 
Place harvested roots in strong well-ventilated field containers for transport from the field
Wooden crates or strong plastic containers are much better field containers than sacks or reed baskets, which provide minimal protection to the roots.","
After harvesting, remove any soil or debris from the roots and store 
them in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place to prevent rotting.
If you are storing the cassava for an extended period, 
you may need to treat it with a fungicide to prevent fungal growth
","
After harvesting, clean the cassava roots and store them in a dry, cool place.
 Proper storage will help to prevent spoilage and increase their shelf life.
